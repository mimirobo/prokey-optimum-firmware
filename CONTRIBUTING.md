# Contribute to Trezor MCU

Please read the general instructions you can find on our [wiki](https://wiki.trezor.io/Developers_guide:Contributing).

If you are working on a new feature, you probably want to contribute this to the [trezor-core](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-core) repository instead.
